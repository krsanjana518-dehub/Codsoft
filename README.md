CodSoft Internship Task 1: Number Guessing Game using C++. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user guesses until correct. It gives feedback like “Too high” or “Too low” after each attempt, and congratulates when guessed right. A simple demo of loops, conditions, and randomization.
